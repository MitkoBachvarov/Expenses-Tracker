# Expenses-Tracker

First real try with Angular.js.

### How to operate:
To start, simply run "npm install" then type "http-server" and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 and you should see the application.

### To create:
Currently the tracker accepts only Int numbers - this will be changed so that the tracker accepts double numbers. <br/>
The tracker starts with a predefined list of items - upcoming change to start with an empty list.<br/>
Entries are *not* stored locally after clicking on "Save" button - to be changed so that everything is stored in a separate file. <br/>

### Future development:
#### To be added a user specific log meaning, separate users with different tracking. 
Plan to achieve: Combine "Simple Login" project with this one in order to create a link to MongoDB, where all of the info will be stored.
